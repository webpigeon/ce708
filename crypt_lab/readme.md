# CE708 - Basic Cryptography Exercises
***ALL FILES MUST BE IN THE SAME FOLDER TO WORK***

This folder should provide everything you need to get started on the [crypt intro lab](https://orb.essex.ac.uk/ce/CE708/restricted/labs/crypto-intro.html).
You may find some of the parts of the assignment helpful.

## What's in the folder:
* origin.txt
* origin_rot.txt - a subituited version of the origin of speicies (only lowercase letters have been encrypted)
* python_crypt.py - function signatures for the lab

### Tools for testing your code
* test.py - Unit tests for ex1, (run with python3 test.py) 
* run_me.py - interactive runner (fairly untested)

These don't test every possibility but should save you a bit of work :).
