# Python
Python is a very capable language which can be run on a number of platforms (including Linux, Windows and Mac OS X).
It comes pre-installed with most Linux distributions (including Ubuntu, as used in the labs).

## Running python
* You can launch python interactively by typing ```python3``` into a bash window.
* You can write a file which starts with ```#! /usr/bin/env python3``` and mark it as executable (chmod +x myfile.py)
* You can write a file and run it with python directly (```python3 myfile.py```)

## Python Versions
* Python 3 is **not** python 2, if you run  ```python``` rather than ```python3``` you will have launched python 2.
